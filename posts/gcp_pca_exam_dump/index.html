<h2 id="ehr-healthcare">EHR Healthcare</h2>
<h4 id="company-overview">Company overview</h4>
<p>EHR Healthcare is a leading provider of electronic health record software to the medical industry. EHR Healthcare provides their software as a service to multi-national medical office, hospitals, and insurance providers.</p>
<h4 id="solution-concept">Solution concept</h4>
<p>Due to rapid changes in the healthcare and insurance industry, EHR Healthcare&rsquo;s business has been growing exponentially year over year. They need to be able to scale their environment, adapt their disaster recovery plan, and roll out new continuous deployment capabilities to update their software at a fast pace. Google Cloud has been chosen to replace their current colocation facilities.</p>
<h4 id="existing-technical-environment">Existing technical environment</h4>
<p>EHR&rsquo;s software is currently hosted in multiple colocation facilities. The lease on one of the data centers is about to expire.</p>
<p>Customer-facing applications are web-based, and many have recently been containerized to run on a group of Kubernetes clusters. Data is stored in a mixture of relational and NoSQL databases (MySQL, MS SQL Server, Redis, and MongoDB).</p>
<p>EHR is hosting several legacy file- and API-based integrations with insurance providers on-premises. These systems are scheduled to be replaced over the next several years. There is no plan to upgrade or move these systems at the current time.</p>
<p>Users are managed via Microsoft Active Directory. Monitoring is currently being done via various open source tools. Alerts are sent via email and are often ignored.</p>
<h4 id="business-requirements">Business requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>On-board new insurance providers as quickly as possible</li>
<li>Provide a minimum 99.9% availability for all customer-facing systems</li>
<li>Provide centralized visibility and proactive action on system performance and usage</li>
<li>Increase ability to provide insights into healthcare trends</li>
<li>Reduce latency to all customers</li>
<li>Maintain regulatory compliance</li>
<li>Decrease infrastructure administration costs</li>
<li>Make predictions and generate reports on industry trends based on provider data</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="technical-requirements">Technical requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Maintain legacy interfaces to insurance providers with connectivity to both on-premises systems and cloud providers</li>
<li>Provide a consistent way to manage customer-facing applications that are container-based</li>
<li>Provide a secure and high-performance connection between on-premises systems and Google Cloud</li>
<li>Provide consistent logging, log retention, monitoring, and alerting capabilities</li>
<li>Maintain and manage multiple container-based environments</li>
<li>Dynamically scale and provision new environments</li>
<li>Create interfaces to ingest and process data from new providers</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="executive-statement">Executive statement</h4>
<p>Our on-premises strategy has worked for years but has required a major investment of time and money in training our team on distinctly different systems, managing similar but separate environments, and responding to outages. Many of these outages have been a result of misconfigured systems, inadequate capacity to manage spikes in traffic, and inconsistent monitoring practices. We want to use Google Cloud to leverage a scalable, resilient platform that can span multiple environments seamlessly and provide a consistent and stable user experience that positions for future growth.</p>
<h4 id="01">01</h4>
<p>Anonymous users from all over the world access a public health information website hosted in an on-premises EHR data center. The servers that host this website are older, and users are complaining about sluggish response times. There has also been a recent increase of distributed denial-of-service attacks toward the website. The attacks always come from the same IP address ranges. EHR management has identified the public health information website as an easy, low risk application to migrate to Google Cloud. You need to improve access latency and provide a security solution that will prevent the denial-of-service traffic from entering your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. What should you do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>☀︎ Deploy an external <strong>HTTP(S) load balancer</strong>, configure <strong>Google Cloud Armor</strong>, and move the application onto Compute Engine virtual machines ☀︎</p>
<p>External HTTP(S) load balancer &mdash; 可以改善存取延遲</p>
<p>Cloud Armor &mdash; 可以封鎖 DDoS 攻擊(Distributed Denial-of-Service)</p>
<p>Firewall rules &mdash; 無法封鎖惡意流量(malicious traffic)進 VPC，只在 VM level 封鎖</p>
<p>GKE service &mdash; does not expose a set of pods outside of a cluster</p>
<p>GKE network policy &mdash; only filters traffic between pods and services</p>
<p>GKE internal load balancer &mdash; will not load balance external traffic</p>
<p>IAP (identity-aware proxy) &mdash; not a fit, as anonymous users need access to the website</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="02">02</h4>
<p>EHR wants to connect one of their data centers to Google Cloud. The data center is in a remote location over 100 kilometers from a Google-owned point of presence. They can&rsquo;t afford new hardware, but their existing firewall can accommodate future throughput growth. They also shared these data points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Servers in their on-premises data center need to talk to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) resources in the clould</li>
<li>Both on-premises servers and cloud resources are configured with private RFC 1918 addresses</li>
<li>The service provider has informed the customer that basic Internet connectivity is a best-effort service with no SLA</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to recommend a connectivity option. What should you recommend?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>☀︎ Provision a <strong>Partner Interconnect connection</strong> ☀︎</p>
<p>Partner interconnect connection &mdash; allows the customer to lower latency by connecting directly to a partner network that is directly connected to Google. This option will also allow the customer to use the lower bandwidth interfaces that they have on their current firewall.</p>
<p>Carrier peering &mdash; does not give private IP addressing across the connection</p>
<p>A new Internet connection &mdash; is not correct, because an additional Internet connection won&rsquo;t provide RFC1918 communications by itself</p>
<p>Dedicated Interconnect connection &mdash; would require the customer to buy new hardware to get a 10 gig interface for their firewall</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="03">03</h4>
<p>One of EHR&rsquo;s healthcare customers is an internationally renowned research and hospital facility. Many of their patients are well-known public personalities. Sources both inside and outside have tried many times to obtain health information on these patients for malicious purposes.  The hospital requires that patient information stored in Cloud Storage buckets not leave the geographic areas in which the buckets are hosted. You need to ensure that information stored in Cloud Storage buckets in the &ldquo;Europe-west2&rdquo; region does not leave that area. What should you do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>☀︎ <strong>Enable Virtual Private Cloud Service Controls</strong>, and create a <strong>service perimeter</strong> around the Cloud Storage resources ☀︎</p>
<p>VPC Service Controls &mdash; improves your ability to mitigate (減輕, 使緩和) the risk of data exfiltration (資料外洩) from Google Cloud services.</p>
<p>Encrypt the data in the application on-premises before the data is stored in the <code>europe-west2</code> region &mdash; Not correct, as encryptng the data does not stop data exfiltration
只是加密資料並不能阻止資料外洩</p>
<p>Assign the identity and access management (IAM) &ldquo;storage.objectViewer&rdquo; role only to users and service accounts that need to use the data &mdash; Not correct, as IAM roles deal with identity-based access control, not context-aware perimeter security.
IAM role 用來處理 <strong>基於身分別的</strong> 存取權控制，而非 <strong>情境感知</strong> 周圍資安</p>
<p>Create an access control list (ACL) that limits access to the bucket to authorized users only, and apply it to the buckets in the &ldquo;europe-west2&rdquo; region &mdash; Not correct, as Cloud Storage ACLs are a mechanism you can use to define who has access to your buckets and objects, as well as their level of access. ACLs do not stop data exfiltration.
ACL用來定義哪些人可存取你的buckets＆objects、以及他們的存取等級，並不能拿來阻止資料外洩</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="04">04</h4>
<p>The EHR sales employees are a remote-based workforce that travels to different locations to do their jobs. Regardless of their location, the sales employees need to access web-based sales tools located in the EHR data center. EHR is retiring their current Virtual Private Network (VPN) infrastructure, and you need to move the web-based sales tools to a BeyondCorp access model. Each sales employee has a Google Workspace account and uses that account for single sign-on (SSO). What should you do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>☀︎ Create an <strong>Identity-Aware Proxy</strong> (IAP) connector that points to the sales tool application ☀︎</p>
<p>Identity-Aware Proxy &mdash; allows you to manage access to HTTP-based apps outside of Google Cloud
身份感知代理 可用來管理GoogleCloud以外，HTTP-based應用程式的存取權限</p>

<p><strong>Simulating production load in GCP can scale in an economical way.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>❌ Use the existing infrastructure to test the GCP-based backend at scale
One of the pain points about the existing infrastructure was precisely that the environment did not scale well.</p>
<p>❌ Build stress tests into each component of your application using resources internal to GCP to simulate load
It is a best practice to have a clear separation between test and production environments, and generating test load should not be done from a production environment.</p>
<p>❌ Create a set of static environments in GCP to test different levels of load, for example high/medium/low</p>

<p>Their most recent endeavor is to create a retro-style first-person shooter (FPS) game that allows hundreds of simultaneous players to join a geo-specific digital arena from multiple platforms and locations. A real-time digital banner will display a global leaderboard of all the top players across every active arena.</p>
<h4 id="solution-concept-2">Solution concept</h4>
<p>Mountkirk Games is building a new multiplayer game that they expect to be very popular. They plan to deploy the game&rsquo;s backend on Google Kubernetes Engine so they can scale rapidly and use Google&rsquo;s global load balancer to route players to the closest regional game arenas. In order to keep the global leader board in sync, they plan to use a multi-region Spanner cluster.</p>
<h4 id="existing-technical-environment-1">Existing technical environment</h4>
<p>The existing environment was recently migrated to Google Cloud, and five games came across using lift-and-shift virtual machine migrations, with a few minor exceptions.</p>
<p>Each new game exists in an isolated Google Cloud project nested below a folder that maintains most of the permissions and network policies. Legacy games with low traffic have been consolidated into a single project. There are also separate environments for development and testing.</p>
<h4 id="business-requirements-2">Business requirements</h4>

</ul>
<h4 id="executive-statement-1">Executive statement</h4>
<p>Our last game was the first time we used Google Cloud, and it was a tremendous success. We were able to analyze player behavior and game telemetry in ways that we never could before. This success allowed us to bet on a full migration to the cloud and to start building all-new games using cloud-native design principles. Our new game is our most ambitious to date and will open up doors for us to support more gaming platforms beyond mobile. Latency is our top priority, although cost management is the next most important challenge. As with our first cloud-based game, we have grown to expect the cloud to enable advanced analytics capabilities so we can rapidly iterate on our deployments of bug fixes and new functionality.</p>

<p>You are the data compliance officer for Mountkirk Games and must protect customers&rsquo; personally identifiable information (PII). Mountkirk Games wants to make sure they can generate anonymized usage reports about their new game and delete PII data after a specific period of time. The solution should have minimal cost. You need to ensure compliance while meeting business and technical requirements. What should you do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ Archive audit logs in BigQuery, and generate reports using Google Data Studio</p>
<p>BigQuery &mdash; allows easy querying for report generation, with low storage costs
BigQuery查詢/生成報表容易，儲存成本低</p>
<p>❌ Archive audit logs in Cloud Storage, and manually generate reports &mdash; Not correct, as Cloud Storage is an object store with no query language access for report generation.
Cloud Storage不支持SQL查詢，生成不了報表</p>
<p>❌ Write a Cloud Logging filter to export specific date ranges to Pub/Sub &mdash; Not correct, as it does not address log storage for data retention
沒有提到 log 資料留存的空間</p>
<p>❌ Archive user logs on a locally attached persistent disk, and cat them to a text file for auditing &mdash; Not correct, as long term storage in persistent disk is expensive

<p>You need to implement Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Service Controls for Mountkirk Games. Mountkirk Games wants to allow Cloud Shell usage by its developers. Developers should not have full access to managed services. You need to balance these conflicting goals with Mountkirk Games&rsquo; business requirements. What should you do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ Create a <strong>service perimeter around only the projects that handle sensitive data</strong>, and do not grant your developers access to it</p>
<p>VPC Service Controls &mdash; protects data
Cloud Shell &mdash; facilitates rapid iteration of Google Cloud architecture changes</p>
<p>VPC Service Controls  &mdash; do not directly affect scaling of Google Cloud architecture.</p>
<p>A security perimeter &mdash; is not a business requirement, but rapid iteration is.</p>
<p>❌ Include all developers in an access level associated with the service perimeter, and allow them to use Cloud Shell &mdash; Not correct, as it works but does not scale, and we do not want to give users this much access</p>

<p>Your new game running on Google Cloud is in public beta, and you want to design meaningful service level objectives (SLOs) before the game becomes generally available. What should you do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ Define one SLO as 99% HTTP requests return the 2xx status code. Define the other SLO as 99% requests return within 100ms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Correct, as it clearly defines <strong>the service level indicators and how to measure them</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>❌ Define one SLO as 99.9% game server availability. Define the other SLO as less than 100-ms latency &mdash; Incorrect, as it doesn&rsquo;t clearly define how to measure both the availability and latency</p>
<p>❌ Define one SLO as service availability that is the same as Google Cloud&rsquo;s availability. Define the other SLO as 100-ms latency &mdash; Incorrect, as Google Cloud availability has an impact on customer availability, but it is only one factor. Also, for different Google Cloud products, the availability could be different.</p>
<p>❌ Define one SLO as total uptime of the game server within a week. Define the other SLO as the mean response time of all HTTP requests that are less than 100 ms &mdash; Incorrect, as there is not objective for the server uptime.</p>

<h2 id="-terramearth-old">🧩 TerramEarth (old)</h2>
<h4 id="company-overview--">Company Overview -</h4>
<p>TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries: about 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.</p>
<h4 id="company-background--">Company background -</h4>
<p>TerramEarth was formed in 1946, when several small, family owned combined to retool after World War II. The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be extended members of their family.</p>
<p>TerramEarth is proud of their ability to innovate on their core products and find new markets as their customers&rsquo; needs change. For the past 20 years, trends in the industry have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with a human operator.</p>
<h4 id="solution-concept---1">Solution Concept -</h4>
<p>There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.</p>
<p>Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, Terram Earth collects a total of about 9TB/day from these connectd vehicles.</p>

</code></pre><p>TerramEarth&rsquo;s existing architecture is composed of Linux-based systems that reside in a data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via FTP, transform and aggregate(聚集) them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.</p>
<p>With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.</p>
<h4 id="business-requirements--">Business Requirements -</h4>
<p>Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week, without increasing the cost of carrying surplus inventory</p>
<p>Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services</p>
<p>Have the ability to partner with different companies &ldquo;especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business&rdquo; to create compelling joint offerings for their customers.</p>
<h4 id="ceo-statement--">CEO Statement -</h4>
<p>We have been successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly, and TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our customers with better services, such as our intelligent farming equipment. With this technology, we have been able to increase farmers&rsquo; yields by 25%, by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have led to rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50% of our revenues by 2020.</p>
<h4 id="cto-statement--">CTO Statement -</h4>
<p>Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process, with our abilty to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I&rsquo;m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn&rsquo;t take technology obsolescence(科技廢退) seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be riche player. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.</p>

<h4 id="company-overview---1">Company Overview -</h4>
<p>TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries. About 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.</p>
<h4 id="solution-concept---2">Solution Concept -</h4>
<p>There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.</p>
<p>Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second, with 22 hours of operation per day, TerramEarth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.</p>
<h4 id="existing-technical-environment---1">Existing Technical Environment -</h4>
<p>TerramEarth&rsquo;s existing architecture is composed of Linux and Windows-based systems that reside in a single U.S, west coast based data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via FTP, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.</p>
<p>With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.</p>
<h4 id="business-requirements---1">Business Requirements -</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week</p>

<p>Our CEO, S. Hawke, wants to bring high-adrenaline racing to fans all around the world. We listen to our fans, and they want enhanced video streams that include <!-- raw HTML omitted -->predictions of events within the race<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (e.g. overtaking). Our current platform allows us to predict race outcomes but laks the facility to support real-time predictions during races and the capacity to process season-long results.</p>

<p>Your team is in charge of creating a payment card data vault for card numbers used to bill tens of thousands of viewers, merchandise consumers, and season ticket holders. You need to implement a custom card tokenization service that meets the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must provide low latency at minimal cost</li>
<li>It must be able to identify duplicate credit cards and must not store plaintext card numbers</li>
<li>It should support annual key rotation</li>
</ul>
<p>Which storage approach should you adopt for your tokenization service?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ Encrypt the card data with a deterministic algorithm (and) stored in Firestore using Datastore mode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deterministic output: A given set of inputs (card number, expiration, userID) will always generate the same token. This is useful if you want to rely on the token value to de-duplicate your token stores. You can simply match a newly generated token to your existing catalog of tokens to determine whether the card has been previously stored.</p>
<p>Depending on your application, this can be a very useful feature, but this could also be accomplished using a salted hash of the input values.</p>

<p>Firestore is the next major version of Datastore. Firestore can run in Datastore mode, which uses the same API as Datastore and scales to millions of writes per second.</p>

<p>Recently HRL started a new regional racing league in Cape Town, South Africa. In an effort to give customers in Cape Town a better user experience, HRL has partnered with the Content Delivery Network provider, Fastly. HRL needs to allow traffic coming from all of the Fastly IP address ranges into their Virtual Private Cloud network (VPC network). You are a member of the HRL security team and you need to configure the update that will allow only the Fastly IP address ranges through the External HTTP(S) load balancer. Which command should you use?</p>

<p>You are designing a future-proof hybrid environment that will require network connectivity between Google Cloud and your on-premises environment. You want you ensure that the Google Cloud environment you are designing is compatible with your on-premises networking environment. What should you do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>☀︎ Create a network plan for your VPC in Google Cloud that uses non-overlapping CIDR ranges with your on-premises environment. Use a Cloud Interconnect connection between your on-premises environment and Google Cloud. ☀︎
&mdash; Correct, as this ensures your on premises network is compatible with your Google Cloud VPC.</p>
<p>Use the default VPC in your Google Cloud project. Use a Cloud VPN connection between your on-premises environment and Google Cloud &mdash; Incorrect, as the default VPC is a VPC with Auto Mode IP ranges, which has the same problem as answer C</p>
<p>Create a custom VPC in Google Cloud auto mode. Use a Cloud VPN connection between your on-premises environment and Google Cloud &mdash; Incorrect, because with Auto Mode IP ranges there is no guarantee that the IP ranges will not overlap with your on premises environment, either now or in the future.</p>
<p>Create a network plan for your VPC in Google Cloud that uses CIDR ranges that overlap with your on-premises environment. Use a Cloud Interconnect connection between your on-premises environment and Google Cloud &mdash; Incorrect, because to ensure correct routing, ranges cannot overlap between environments.</p>

<p>Your company wants to track whether someone is present in a meeting room reserved for a scheduled meeting. There are 1000 meeting rooms across 5 offices on 3 continents. Each room is equipped with a motion sensor that reports its status every second. You want to support the data ingestion needs of this sensor network. The receiving infrastructure needs to account for the possibility that the devices may have inconsistent connectivity. Which solution should you design?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>☀︎ Have devices poll for connectivity to Pub/Sub and publish the latest messages on a regular interval to a shared topic for all devices ☀︎</p>
<p>Pub/Sub &mdash; Correct, as it can handle the frequency of this data, and consumers of the data can pull from the shared topic for further processing.</p>
<p>Have each device create a persistent connection to a Compute Engine instance and write messages to a custom application &mdash; Incorrect, as having a persistent connection does not handle the case where the device is disconnected.</p>
<p>Have devices poll for connectivity to Cloud SQL and insert the latest messages on a regular interval to a device specific table &mdash; Incorrect, as Cloud SQL is a regional, relational database and not the best fit for sensor data. Additionally, the frequency of the writes has the potential to exceed the supported number of concurrent</p>
<p>Have devices create a persistent connection to an App Engine application fronted by Cloud Endpoints, which ingest messages and write them to Datastore &mdash; Incorrect, as having a persistent connection does NOT handle the case where the device is disconnected.</p>

<p>Your company wants to try out the cloud with low risk. They want to archive approximately 100TB of their log data to the cloud and test the serverless analytics features available to them there, while also retaining that data as a long-term disaster recovery backup. Which two steps should they take? (Choose two)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ Load logs into BigQuery
Correct, as BigQuery is a serverless cloud data warehouse for analytics and supports the volume and analytics requirement (無伺服器/支援量/支援分析)</p>
<p>✅ Upload log files into Cloud Storage
Correct, as Cloud Storage provides the Coldline and Archive storage classes to support long-term storage with infrequent access, which would support the long-term disaster recovery backup requirement (備份用, coldline / archive - 90天/一年存取一次)</p>
<p>❌ Log logs into Cloud SQL
Incorrect, as it does not support the expected 100 TB. Additionally, Cloud SQL is a relational database and not the best fit for time-series log data formats (Cloud SQL 不支援到 100 terabytes 且關聯式資料庫不是時間序列數據格式的最佳選擇)</p>
<p>❌ Import logs into Cloud Logging
Incorrect, as Cloud Logging is optimized for monitoring, error reporting, and debugging instead of analytics queries (Cloud Logging適用：監測、回報錯誤、除錯, 不用在分析查詢)</p>
<p>❌ Insert logs into Cloud Bigtable
Incorrect, as Cloud BigTable is optimized for read-write latency and analytics throughput, not analytics querying and reporting (BigTable優勢：讀寫延遲性 以及 分析高吞吐量, 不適合查詢分析/產製報表)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="04-6">04</h4>
<p>You set up an autoscaling managed instance group to serve web traffic for an upcoming launch. After configuring the instance group as a backend service to an HTTP(S) load balancer, you notice that virtual machine (VM) instances are being terminated and re-launched every minute. The instances do not have a public IP address. You have verified that the appropriate web response is coming from each instance using the curl command. You want to ensure that the backend is configured correctly. What should you do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ Ensure that a firewall rule exists to allow load balancer health checks to reach the instances in the instance group
Correct, as health check failures lead to a VM being marked unhealthy and can result in termination if the health check continues to fail. Because you have already verified that the instances are functioning properly, the next step would be to determine why the health check is continuously failing.</p>
<p>❌ Ensure that a firewall rule exists to allow source traffic on HTTP/HTTPS to reach the load balancer
Incorrect, as the issue to resolve is the VMs being terminated, not access to the load balancer.</p>
<p>❌ Assign a public IP to each instance, and configure a firewall rule to allow the load balancer to reach the instance public IP
Incorrect, as this introduce a security vulnerability without addressing the primary concern of the VM termination.</p>
<p>❌ Create a tag on each instance with the name of the load balancer. Configure a firewall rule with the name of the load balancer as the source and the instance tag as the destination
Incorrect, as the source of the firewall rule that allows load balancer and health check access to instances is defined IP ranges, and not a named load balancer. Tagging the instances for the purpose of firewall rules is appropriate but would probably be a descriptor of the application, and not the load balancer.</p>

<h4 id="05-6">05</h4>
<p>Your organization has a 3-tier web application deployed in the same Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Each tier (web, API, and database) scales independently of the others. Network traffic should flow through the web to the API tier, and then on to the database tier. Traffic should not flow between the web and the database tier. How should you configure the network with minimal steps?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ Add tags to each tier and set up firewall rules to allow the desired traffic flow
Correct, because as instances scale, they will all have the same tag to identify the tier. These tags can then be leveraged in firewall rules to allow and restrict traffic as required, because tags can be used for both the target and source.</p>
<p>❌ Add each tier to a different subnetwork
Incorrect, as the subnetwork alone will not allow and restrict traffic as required without firewall rules.</p>
<p>❌ Set up software-based firewalls on individual VMs</p>
<p>​    Incorrect, as this adds complexity to the architecture and the instance configuration.</p>
<p>❌ Add tags to each tier and set up routes to allow the desired traffic flow
Incorrect, as routes still require firewall rules to allow traffic as requests. Additionally, the tags are used for defining the instances the route applies to, and not for identifying the next hop. The next hop is either an IP range or instance name, but in the proposed solution the tiers are only identified by tags.</p>

<h4 id="06-5">06</h4>
<p>You are designing a large distributed application with 30 microservices. Each of your distributed microservices needs to connect to a database backend. You want to store the credentials securely. Where should you store the credentials?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ In a secret management system
Correct, as a secret management system such as Secret Manager is a secure and convenient storage system for API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data. Secret Manager provides a central place and single source of truth to manage, access and audit secrets across Google Cloud.</p>
<p>❌ In the source code
Incorredt, as storing credentials in source code and source control is discoverable, in plain text, by anyone with access to the source code. This also introduces the requirement to update code and do a deployment each time the credentials are rotated.</p>
<p>❌ In an environment variable
Incorrect, as consistently populating environment variables would require the credentials to be available, in plain text, when the session is started.</p>
<p>❌ In a config file that has restricted access through ACLs
Incorrect, bcuz instead of managing access to the config file and updating manually as keys are rotated, it would be better to leverage a key management system. Additionally, there is increased risk if the config file contains the credentials in plain text.</p>
